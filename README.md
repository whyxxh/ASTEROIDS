# How to play ?
if you are familiar with a terminal go ahead it is pretty obvious, else:
- clone the repo
- go to the ASTEROIDS directory in your terminal
- either do `./run.sh` or `make` followed by `make run`.
there will be debugging print messages i forgot to remove, will be fixed soon.


# TO-DO:
- add screen shake
- fix delta time
